* KL divergence visual explanation
* Heart cycle duration normality study (from homework)
* Complex Wavelets decomposition as the first layer of conv NN
* What application development community can learn from robotics community
    * What "microservice architecture" looks like in robotics
      * nodes, parameters, topics, services, actions
    * Behaviour trees vs state machines and "sagas"
* What robotics community can learn from application development community
  * Embrace containerization
  * Embrace additional languages, polyglot programming (right now only C/C++, Python)
    Rust - security, concurrency, performance (scientific computing is meh?)
    Javascript - "Webify" robots, for the Robot Ops kind of tasks like fleet mgt, remote access, debugging
  * Move to the cloud - for the development, simulation, and deployment of some parts
  * More web tools - very Linux focused experience. All GUI tools at Qt
